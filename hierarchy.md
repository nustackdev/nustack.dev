## Core Package

### everybase

Unified core package with two subpackages.

#### everybase.core (contracts)

Pure contracts. No implementations, no external deps.

```
Node            immutable tree node
Executable      typed subtree
Term            computation (execute -> result)
  LValue        addressable location (resolve -> substrate location)
    Ref         typed reference (fetch -> value)
  RValue        evaluable expression
    Morphism    transformation (apply -> result)
Flow            ordering (Seq, Par, Cond, Loop)
Span            cohesion boundary (enter/exit context)
Context         type-keyed handle container
Model           marker base for structure definitions (Shape, Table extend this)
Sentinel        EMPTY / INVALID propagation
```

#### everybase.abc (base implementations)

Universal building blocks.

```
Types           IntType, StrType, FloatType, BoolType, BytesType
Values          IntValue, StrValue, FloatValue, BoolValue, BytesValue, ...
Capabilities    loc_item (get/set/delete/exists)
                loc_collection (extract/store/length/clear/exists)
                loc_reactive (on_change observers)
Morphisms       base morphism implementations
Utilities       ensure_term, tree walking, etc.
```

### everyshape

Document model. Depends on everybase.

```
Shape System    ShapeMeta, Shape (extends Model), SlotDescriptor

Slot            universal slot that creates any Ref type (used by Ref.slot())

Ref Base        Ref (document-model ref contract: address, parent, shape, slot())

Items           ItemRef -> MutableItemRef -> ReactiveItemRef
                (typed value holders with CRUD + observation)

Collections     ShapeRef -> MutableShapeRef -> ReactiveShapeRef
                (structured containers with attribute navigation)

                MappingRef -> MutableMappingRef -> ReactiveMappingRef
                (key-value containers)

                SequenceRef -> MutableSequenceRef -> ReactiveSequenceRef
                (ordered containers)

                ShapesListRef / ShapesDictRef (+ Mutable / Reactive)
                (homogeneous shape collections)
```

### everytable

Abstract relational model. Depends on everybase. (TBD)

## Dependency Graph

```
                    everybase
                  (core + abc)
                    /       \
            everyshape    everytable
                |             |
            every-pv     everytable
            every-dict       |
                |        every-notion
          every-type  every-flow
          every-flow-ext
```

Key constraints:

- everyshape and everytable are siblings -- both depend on everybase
- everyshape has zero PV imports -- substrate-independent document model
- everytable has zero PV imports -- independent data model
- every-pv depends on everyshape (PV substrate: persistent, reactive)
- every-dict depends on everyshape (dict substrate: plain dicts, no reactivity)
- every-notion will depend on everytable (relational adapter)
